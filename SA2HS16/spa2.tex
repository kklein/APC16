%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{homeworkProblem}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%%%%% a)
\item
	For the sake of contradiction, let's assume \(\tau(F) < \mu(F)\).\\
	Say \( \tau(F) = min\ |T| = k\). Sizes of sets must be integers, hence \(k \in \mathbb{N}\). It follows directly that \(\mu(F)=max\ |M| \geq k+1\). The latter expresses that \(k+1\) flags can be simultaneously  represented without assigning a dancer to more than one flag. These \(k+1\) flags of the Olympic matching are by definition pairwise dstinct, meaning that no color is present in more than one of those flags. \\
	By definition, an Olympic traversal has to pass all flags and thereby also the \(k+1\) flags in the Olympic matching. However, as those flags are mutually distinct, the necessary amount of colors to traverse the matching is \(k+1\). This number can only increase when adding colors to traverse flags which are not part of the Olympic matching. Hence \(\tau(F) \geq k+1 \). \\
	This contradicts are assumption. Therefore we have proven that \( \mu(F) \leq \tau(F) \). 

%%%%% b)
\item
	Firstly, we need to show that such a \( \tau^{*}(F)\) exists. In order to do so we demonstrate that LP-T is bounded and feasible, which implies existance of an optimal solution. \\
	The cost function increases with every component of x. This is to say that it will attain minimal value if the components of x are 'as small as possible'. However, due to the constraint that \(x \geq 0 \), we know that the components of \(x\) must be at least \(0\). When can thereby formulate the lower bound \( 1_n^T 0_n = 0 \) for the minimized result. Thusly, LP-T is bounded. \\
	In order to show that LP-T is feasible, we will look at the structure of \(A\). The matrix knowingly consists of solely \(0's\) and \(1's\). Using the information that each flag uses at least one colour, we can tell that every row holds at least one \(1\). In order to satisfy the constraint that the dotproduct of each row with \(x\) is larger or equal to \(1\), we can simply set all components of \(x\) to \(1\). Furthermore, \(x = 1_n\) also trivially satisfies the remaining constraint, namely \(x \leq 0\). Thererfore \(x\) is a witness for feasibility of LP-T. \\
	We now know that LP-T is bounded, feasible and thereby has an optimal solution \( \tau^{*}(F) \). \\
	When closeely observing the definition of \( T\) and \(\tau(F)\), it becomes apparent, that we can express it as an integer linear program with strong resemblance to LP-T. Instead of declaring \(T\) as a set, we can express \(T\) as the vector \(x\), indicating \(x_i = \mathbb{I}[c_i \in T ]\). It follows directly that \( \tau(F) = |T| = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 1_n ^Tx \). The constraint that the traversal \(x\) must include at least one color of each flag, can be enforced by counting the number of colors each flag and the traversal have in common and making sure this count is always at least 1. This corresponds to the dotproduct between a row of \(A\), representing the colors in a flag, and the traversal \(x\). We can thereby formulate \(\tau(F)\) as the optimal value resulting from:
	\[ minimize\ 1_n^Tx,\ subject\ to\ Ax \geq 1_m,\ x \in \{0,1\}^n 
	\]
	We can argue analogously that this integer linear program has an optimal value. \\
	The integer LP we came to formulate is only more restrictive than LP-T. Hence, a traversal \(x\) leading to the optimal value for the integer linear program, will yield the same value for LP-T. Yet, LP-T might allow for an even better solution, as we will show in c). We have proven that \(\tau^{*}(F) \leq \tau(F)\).

%%%%% c)
\item
	Suppose the flags \( f_1 = \{c1,c2\},\ f_2 = \{c1,c3\},\ f_3 = \{c2,c3\} \). \\
	In other words:
	\[
	A = \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 1 & 0 \\
		1 & 0 & 1 \\
		0 & 1 & 1 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\]
	We see that no color is contained in all three flags. Hence the traversal will require at least two colors. We write \( \tau(F) \geq 2 \). 
	Let us inspect \( x_S = \begin{bmatrix}
		0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\
	\end{bmatrix}^T \). Firstly, our \(x_s\) satisfies \(x \geq 0_n\). Secondly 
	\[
	A \cdot x_s =  \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 1 & 0 \\
		1 & 0 & 1 \\
		0 & 1 & 1 \\
	\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
		0.5 \\
		0.5 \\
		0.5 \\
	\end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix}
		1 \\
		1 \\
		1 \\
	\end{bmatrix} \geq 1_m.
	\]
	Thereby, we can conclude that \(x_s\) is a feasible solution for LP-T. Furthermore, the optimal value \(\tau^{*} (F) \) must be smaller or equal to the value that the cost function yields for $x_s$. This follows from the simple fact that the cost function is minimizing. Hence \(\tau^{*}(F) <= 1_n^T \cdot x_s = 1.5\). \\
	It follows directly that \(\tau^{*}(F) \leq \tau(F) \).
	
%%%% d)
\item
	In order to prove \(\mu(F) \leq \tau(F) \) we will first show \( \mu(F) \leq \mu^{*}(F)\) followed by \( \mu^{*}(F) \leq \tau(F) \). \\
	We define \( \mu^{*}(F) \) to be the optimal value of the following linear program LP-D: \\
	\[ maximize\ 1_m^T y\ subject\ to\ A^Ty \leq 1,\ y \geq 0
	\]
	We observe that LP-D corresponds to the definition of the dual of LP-T. As we have shown that LP-T is bounded and has optimal value \(\tau^{*}(F)\), the Strong Duality Theorem tells us that LP-D has optimal value \(\tau^{*}(F)\). \\
	Similarly as in (b), we will translate the meaning of an Olympic matching \(M\) to an integer linear program and show that this integer linear program is only more constrained than LP-D. \\
	Instead of declaring \(M\) as a set, we can express \(M\) as the vector \(y\), indicating \(y_i = \mathbb{I}[f_i \in M]\). It follows directly that \( \mu(F) = |M| = \sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i = 1_m ^Ty \). The constraint that the matching \(y\) must assign each color to at most one flag, i.e. the flags are pairwise distinct, can be enforced by counting the number of flags each color appears in and making sure this count is always at most 1. This corresponds to the dotproduct between a row of \(A^T\), representing for all flags whether they contain a specific color, and the matching \(y\). We can thereby formulate \(\mu(F)\) as the optimal value resulting from:
	\[ maximize\ 1_m^T y\ subject\ to\ A^Ty \leq 1,\ y \in \{0,1\}^m
	\]
	\(y = 1_m\) yields an upper lower bound for \(\mu(F)\), namely \(1_m^{T}1_m = m\). \(y = 0_m\) yields an obvious feasible solution. Hence the integer linear program has an optimal solution \(\mu(F)\). \\
	The integer LP we came to formulate is only more restrictive than LP-D. Hence, a matching \(y\) leading to the optimal value for the integer linear program, will yield the same value for LP-D. Yet, LP-T might allow for an even better, i.e. larger, solution, as it is less restrictive and maximizing the cost function. We have proven that \(\mu(F) \leq \mu^{*}(F)\).
	
	Thanks to the Strong Duality Theorom we know that \(\mu^{*}(F) = \tau^{*}(F)\). (b) tells us that \(\tau^{*}(F) \leq \tau(F)\) which implies \(\mu^{*}(F) \leq \tau(F)\).
	
	We have proven that \(\mu(F) \leq \tau(F) \).

%%%% e)
\item

%%%% f)
\item
	\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	%%%%% i)
	\item
		We want to show that the columns of \(A\) are linearly independent. \\
		Thanks to the special structure of \(A\), we know that each row contains exactly two \(1\)'s and all other components equal \(0\). 
		Let's inspect an arbitrary column of \(A\) called \(C_j\). 
		If \(C_j = 0\) we can trivially represent \(C_j\) as a combination of other columns and our claim is proven. \\
		Hence we now assume \(C_j \neq 0\). \\
		Let's say that \(A[i,j] = C_j[i] = 1\). As every row contains two \(1\)'s, we know that \(\exists i'\neq i, i' \in \{1,..,m\}\) with \(A[i',j] = 1\).
		
		
		Alternative \\
		If \(m < n\), we know that \( rank(A) \leq dim(rowspace(A)) \leq m\).
		We also know that \( number\ lin.\ ind.\ colums = rank(A) \). Hence \(number\ lin.\ ind.\ colums \leq m < n\). Therefore the columns are linearly dependent. \\
		If \(m \geq n \), we claim that the rows span an \(n-1\) dimensional space. This implies that the rank is \(n-1\) and thereby no \(n\) columns can be linearly independent.
		
	%%%%% ii)
	\item
	In order to show that for each square submatrix \(S\) of \(A\) \(det|S| \in \{-1,0,1\} \), we will proceed by induction. We will say that \(S\) is of size \(i\) by \(i\). \\
	\textit{Base case: i = 1} \\
	\[\forall i \in \{1,..,m\},\ \forall j \in \{1,..,n\}\ A[i,j] \in \{0,1\}\ \Rightarrow det|S| \in \{0,1\}\]
	\textit{Induction step: } \(i \rightarrow i+1\) \\
	In order to make use of our induction hypothesis, we want to compute \(det|S|\), with \(S\) of size \(i+1\) by \(i+1\), by its minors, of size \(i\) by \(i\). Thanks to the fact that \(S\) is a submatrix of \(A\), we can assume that each row of \(S\) has either no, one or two \(1\)'s. Furthermore we know that we can pick any row to calculate \(det|S|\) by corresponding minors. 
	We make the following case distinction:
	\begin{enumerate}[a)]
		\item There is one row in \(S\) with all \(0\)'s. \\
			\(det|S|\) will be calculated by adding the determinant of all minors, scaled by the corrsponding elements of the row. As the latter are all \(0\), it follows immediately that \(det|S| = 0\). 
		\item There is no row in row in \(S\) with all \(0\)'s, there is one row in \(S\) with exactly one \(1\). \\
			\(det|S|\) will be calculated by adding the determinant of all minors, scaled by the corrsponding elements of the row. Hence all determinants of minors but one, call it \(M\) can be ignored. Our induction hypotehsis tells us that \(det|M| \in \{-1,0,1\} \) because \(M\) is of size \(i\) by \(i\) and by definition a submatrix of \(A\). Hence \(det|S|=1\cdot det|M|\) which direcly implies our claim.
		\item There are only rows in \(S\) with exactly two \(1\)'s. \\
			We have two crucial indications about this \(S\). The first one is that it is a submatrix of \(A\). This implies that it has to fulfill the requirement that if two colors are chosen in one row, one of them must be light and the orther dark. We do not reassign colors, hence this must still hold. The second one is that we have two colors in each row of \(S\). \\
			Hence \(S\) would represent a legitimate incidence matrix according to the definition of (f). \\
			Yet we came to prove in (f)(i), that all incidence matrices as described in (f) do have linearly dependent columns. In the case of square matrices, this implies that they are not 'full-rank' or 'invertible'. This again implies that the determinant must be 0. We can conclude \(det|S|=0 \)/
	\end{enumerate} 
	The case distinction is exhaustive and leads a desired result for each case. Hence we have proven the desired statement.
	%%%%% iii)
	\item 
	In order to prove that every basic feasible solution is integral, we first look at the definition of a basic feasible solution. Any basic feasbile solution must satisfy n linearly independent constraints with equality. We say that a basic feasible solution \(\tilde{x}\) solves \(\tilde{A} \dot x = \tilde{b}\) where \(\tilde{A}\) and \(\tilde{b}\) represent n linearly independent constraints from either \(Ax \geq 1_m\) or \(x \geq 0 \). \\
	Cramer's rule tells us that the \(j\)-th component of our basic feasible solution can be computed by:
	\[ \tilde{x_j} = \frac{det|\tilde{A_j}|}{det|\tilde{A}|},\ \ \ \ \ \ \  j \in \{1,..,n\}\]
	where \(\tilde{A_j}\) corresponds to \(\tilde{A}\) and replacing its jth column with \(\tilde{b}\).
	In order to argue that all \(\tilde{x_j}\) are integers, we will look at both numerator and denominator of the fraction. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \(det|\tilde{A_j}|\) \\
			\(\tilde{A}\) contains only 0's and 1's. So does \(\tilde{b}\). Hence \(\tilde{A_j}\) only contains 0's and 1's. When calculating the determinant we will only add, multiply and adapt the sign of elements. Adding, multiplying and changing signs of integers will result in an integer. Therefore \(det|\tilde{A_j}| \in \mathbb{N}\).
		\item \({det|\tilde{A}|}\) \\
			We know that the rows originating from the constraint \(x \geq 0\) containt exaclty one \(1\). For all those rows, we compute recursively compute minors, which always consists of the determinant of a minor multiplied by either \(1\) or \(-1\). When we run out of those rows, we only have rows left from the constraint \(Ax \geq 1_m\). Thusly, those remaining rows stem from A, in other words, the matrix of remaining rows is a submatrix of A. as we have shown in (ii), this submatrix yields a determinant of either -1, 0 or 1. Therefore  \({det|\tilde{A}|}\) is of the form \( (-1)^k\cdot det|M|,\ det|M\ \in \{-1,0,1\}\).\\
			As \(\tilde{A}\) contains n linearly independent rows, we know that its determinant cannot equal \(0\). \\
			It follows that \({det|\tilde{A}|} \in \{-1,1\}\).
	\end{enumerate}
	We can come to the conclusion that \( \forall j \in \{1,..,n\},\ \tilde{x_j} = det|\tilde{A_j}|\ or\ \tilde{x_j} = -det|\tilde{A_j}|\). As \(det|\tilde{A_j}| \in \mathbb{N},\ x_j \in \mathbb{N}\). Hence \(x\) is integral.
	
	%%%%% iv)
	\item
		We know from (b) that \(\tau^*(F)\) is the optimal value of the feasible and bounded linear program LP-T. \\
		Theorem 6.1 allows us to conlcude that a basic feasible solution can attain this optimal value \(\tau^*(F)\).
		We have shown in iii), that all basic feasible solutions are integral. \\
		Combining this knowledge, we know that there is an integral optimal basic feasible solution. \\
		We have argued in b) that \(\tau(F)\) is the optimal value of an integer linear program, which is only more restrive than LP-T. Precisely, it only allows components of the solution to be either 0 or 1. As we already know that we can reach the optimal value of LP-T with integral value, it only remains to show that the optimal basic solution does not contain integers other than 0 and 1, to prove that both optimal values must be equal. \\
		We will prove this via contradiction. \\
		Let's assume that the optimal basic feasible solution \(x\) of LP-T has a component \(j'\) of value \(k \notin \{0,1\}\).	As \(x \geq 0\) holds for all feasible solutions, \(k\) must be positive. To be explicit, \(k \in \{2,3,..\}\). Let's look at the constraints \(Ax \geq 1\). For each row \(i\) in \(A\) in which the \(j'\)th component is 0, the value of \(x_j'\) does not matter. For all others, the constraint corresponds to the following: 
		\[ A_ix \geq 1 \Leftrightarrow \sum_{j=1}^m A[i][j]*x[j] = 1 \cdot k + \sum_{j=1, j \neq j'}^m A[i][j]*x[j] \geq 1\]
		We notice that all those constraints would also be satisfied with \(k=1\). As we know that all constraints would still be satisfied for \(k=1\), no other component would have to be adapted and the cost function is simply adding up the components of \(x\), our \(x\) was not optimal. \\
		We now know that we can add the constraint \(x \in \{0,1\}^n\) to LP-T without influencing the optimal value \(\tau^*(F)\). Yet this corresponds exactly to the integer Linear Program with optimal value \(\tau(F)\). Hence \(\tau^*(F) = \tau(F)\). 
	%%%%% v)
	\item We will prove \( \mu(F) = \tau(F)\) by showing that \( \mu^*(F) = \mu(F)\). This suffices as we know from (d) that \( \mu^*(F) = \tau^*(F) \) as well as \(\tau^*(F)  = \tau(F)\) from (f)(iv). \\
